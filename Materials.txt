Fantastic question. In materials science there’s a lot you can do with
pure thought + fresh code—no datasets, no experiments, no legacy
software—provided you lean on symmetry, topology, variational
principles, and rigorous optimization. Below is a portfolio of problems
where we can produce theorems, certificates, or constructive designs
using only code we write ourselves. I’ve grouped them by theme and, for
each, sketched what, why it fits the constraint, how we’d attack it,
and what artifact proves we’re right.

0) Shared “Day‑0” toolchain (reused across all tracks)

-   Group/rep engine for all 230 space groups + double groups +
    time‑reversal + magnetic (Shubnikov) groups; character tables,
    induction/restriction, little groups at high‑symmetry k.

-   Topological/K‑theory & symmetry‑indicator stack to compute band
    representations (eBRs), symmetry indicators, Stiefel–Whitney
    classes, Chern/(\mathbb{Z}_2) invariants, Wilson loops; all from
    first principles.

-   Verified PDE/eigenvalue solvers (Maxwell, elastodynamics)
    with interval arithmetic to certify spectral gaps and error bounds.

-   Convex & polynomial optimization with proofs: SDP/SoS with exact
    rational certificates; MILP/SAT with DRAT/FRAT logs.

-   Isomorphism‑free lattice/graph enumerators for tight‑binding,
    mechanical frameworks, and microstructures.

Artifacts we’ll always emit: Lean/Isabelle lemmas for theorems, SDP dual
certificates (exact), SAT proof logs, interval‑verified spectra. No
trust required.

1) Topological Band Theory Without Materials Data

What. A complete, constructive classification of which band
topologies are possible for minimal orbital contents and
symmetries—across all (magnetic) space groups—plus minimal tight‑binding
models that realize them.

Why it fits. Entirely symmetry + topology; no parameters from experiment
or databases.

How.

-   Compute eBR decompositions for all Wyckoff positions: determine when
    a set of bands cannot be written as a sum of eBRs → topological.

-   Enumerate minimal graphs (tight‑binding lattices) per space group;
    search hoppings (range ≤ R) that realize desired invariants; certify
    Chern/(\mathbb{Z}_2) via K‑theory/Wilson loops.

    symmetries (hourglass, nodal chains) and produce minimal
    Hamiltonians.

Artifacts. An atlas of minimal models (code + proofs) mapping symmetry →
achievable topologies, and no‑go theorems where impossible.

Milestone. 3–6 months: full non‑magnetic catalog; 6–12 months: magnetic
groups with anti‑unitary symmetries.

2) Flat Chern Bands with Provable Geometry (for fractionalization)

What. Design compact tight‑binding lattices that realize flat (or nearly
flat) bands with target Chern number and provably good quantum

algebra and topology.

How.

-   Enumerate finite‑range hopping graphs; impose algebraic constraints
    for a target Bloch polynomial structure.

    and prove lower bounds on flatness ratio using SoS relaxations of
    dispersion curvature.

    symmetric, localized Wannier functions) as topological proof of
    fractionalization viability.

Artifacts. Tight‑binding Hamiltonians + certificates of Chern number and
flatness bounds.

3) RBCE (Relativistic Band & Crystal‑Field Engineering) — Theorem‑Level

(g)‑tensor anisotropy for all (d^n) configurations across every point
group, including maximizers of magnetocrystalline anisotropy that mimic
rare‑earth behavior.

Why it fits. It’s group theory + crystal field + SOC; no materials
inputs needed.

How.

    SOC in a canonical basis; diagonalize symbolically where possible,
    otherwise with exact arithmetic.

    single‑ion behavior and narrow optical transitions (for optical
    qubits).

splitting patterns, max anisotropy certificates, and explicit model
Hamiltonians.

4) Photonic/Phononic Crystals: Rigorous Bandgap Existence & Optimization

What. Microstructures (2D/3D) with certified complete bandgaps at the

What to start first (highest leverage under your mission)

1.  RBCE symmetry atlas (Track 3): directly advances your
    “rare‑earth‑like without rare earths” agenda; produces hard theorems
    and constructive motifs.

2.  Topological band atlas (Track 1) + flat Chern band design (Track 2):
    foundational and broadly impactful, giving minimal Hamiltonians for
    desired phases.

3.  Certified photonic/phononic bandgaps (Track 4): yields publishable,
    fabrication‑ready unit cells with airtight gap certificates—high
    practical value.

Week‑1 sprints (if you say “go”)

Sprint A — RBCE

-   Implement double‑group irreps for all 32 point groups; validate
    against internal group‑axiom tests.

-   Generate CF+SOC Hamiltonians for (d^n) (n=1…9) with a canonical
    parameterization; compute symbolic anisotropy expansions.

-   Prove: “No uniaxial anisotropy in cubic (O_h) without SOC”
    (baseline), then derive necessary symmetry conditions for Ising‑like
    behavior.
    Artifacts: first Lean lemmas + a small table of (site symmetry,
    (d^n)) → allowed anisotropy terms.

Sprint B — Topological band atlas

-   eBR database (from scratch): induction of site irreps → band reps;
    write decomposition and compatibility code.

-   Produce minimal topological models for a handful of space groups
    (e.g., (p2_12_12_1), (P4/nmm), (P2_13)).
    Artifacts: tight‑binding files + K‑theory certificates.

Sprint C — Certified photonic gaps

-   Verified Maxwell eigensolver for a 2D TE/TM case with interval
    bounds.

-   Reproduce a known gap with a rigorous certificate; then push to
    lower index contrast via topology optimization + dual bounds.
    Artifacts: geometry + interval‑verified gap plot + dual certificate.

If you pick any 2–3 tracks, I’ll draft detailed module layouts (APIs,
certificate formats), initial theorems to target, and the daily run plan
for the first two weeks. Given your current RBCE effort, I suggest we
lead with RBCE + Topological band atlas, and run Certified photonic
gaps in parallel as the first “closed‑loop” PDE+certificate win.
