Alright — you’ve been handed a thinking machine with ~1T tokens/day and
the only I/O you’ll allow is code we generate and run ourselves (no
external datasets, no legacy codes, no lab work). That pushes us toward
problems where progress can be made by logic, mathematics, constructive
algorithms, and internal consistency checks — i.e., domains where the
“oracle” is proof, derivation, or algorithmic search with verifiable
certificates. Below is a concise but sharp plan: selection principles,
the core architecture we should stand up on day 0, and a portfolio of
problem tracks that can genuinely move with this constraint. Each track
lists: what to attempt, why it’s viable without data, how GPT-5 +
self-written code attacks it, and hard milestones.

Guiding principles

-   Proofs > predictions. Target questions that resolve to theorems,
    bounds, constructive counterexamples, or certificates (SAT/SMT
    proofs, SDP dual certificates, cut-generating proofs, Gröbner bases,
    etc.).

-   Self-consistency or first principles only. Physics tracks should
    rely on unitarity, causality, crossing, locality, symmetry,
    convexity; chemistry on quantum mechanics and variational
    principles; math/CS on formal axioms.

-   Search where verification is cheap. Use massive search guided by LLM
    plans, but always demand fast verifiers (proof checkers, unit tests,
    symbolic algebra identities).

-   Formalize by default. Everything gets emitted as (a) human-readable
    proofs, and (b) machine-checkable artifacts (Lean/Isabelle/Coq,
    DRAT/FRAT for SAT, Sum-of-Squares certificates, interval arithmetic
    bounds).

Day-0 system we build once, use everywhere

1.  Autoprover Farm. Multi-agent proof workshop that proposes lemmas,
    attempts multiple proof styles (induction, contradiction, SOS,
    compactness, etc.), and round-trips through proof assistants
    (Lean/Isabelle) we bootstrap from source (we can re-implement a
    minimal kernel if we must).

2.  Symbolic-Numeric Engine. From-scratch CAS: exact rationals,
    algebraic numbers, Gröbner bases, resultants, differential
    operators, tensor calculus, interval arithmetic, automatic
    differentiation; plus self-coded SDP/QP/LP solvers with proof
    logging (e.g., dual certificates, SoS).

3.  Search with certificates. SAT/SMT (CDCL, DPLL(T)), branch-and-bound,
    A* over combinatorial spaces, with certified proof traces
    (DRAT/LLRF, etc.).

4.  Amplitude/Bootstrap toolbox. Code to set up and solve
    crossing/positivity SDPs, build symbol alphabets, do finite-field
    reconstructions, IBP reductions, sector decomposition — all written
    by us and verified.

5.  Tensor Network & Coding Theory Lab. From-scratch TN contractions,
    MPO/MPS/PEPS variational solvers (with rigorous error bars via
    interval arithmetic), and constructive code search (LDPC/QECC) with
    decoding simulations and distance certificates.

With that scaffolding, here’s the problem portfolio most likely to yield
real, citable advances under your constraints.

Execution pattern (per track)

-   Self-contained toolchain emitted by GPT-5 (solver + checker + proof
    exporter).

-   Many-shot strategy generation (varying gauges, bases, relaxations).

-   Parallel search with early proof certificates. Always generate
    verifiable artifacts (Lean files, DRAT clauses, dual SDPs, interval
    bounds).

-   Human-quality “explanations last.” Once a machine certificate
    exists, synthesize the polished proof/exposition.

12-month macro-plan (sketch)

-   Month 1–2: Stand up Autoprover Farm, Symbolic-Numeric Engine,
    SAT/SMT with proof logging, a minimal Lean-like kernel, and an
    SDP/SoS solver that emits exact/rational certificates.

-   Month 3–4: Replicate cornerstone results in A/B/C (bootstrap &
    integrals) and F (Ramsey) to validate pipelines.

-   Month 5–8: Push new bounds in A/B, first new QECC families (D), new
    SSP/symplectic integrators (L).

-   Month 9–12: Deliver at least 3 “best-known” world results with
    machine-checkable proofs (A/B/F), plus one structural classification
    (I or H).

Token budget & parallelism

-   80% to search/proof attempts; 20% to verification and proof
    polishing.

-   Begin with A, B, D, F, I as highest-likelihood short-to-midterm wins
    yielding rigorous outputs with strong scientific impact (physics,
    quantum info, math for science).

-   Keep C, J as moonshots that can pop spectacularly once tooling
    matures.

Why this portfolio is right for your constraint

-   Every track is data-free and experiment-free, grounded in axioms,
    symmetry, or first principles.

-   Each yields objective artifacts (proofs/certificates) that are
    verifiable without trust.

-   The payoff is scientifically nontrivial: tighter bounds in CFT/EFT,
    new families of QECCs, stronger extremal combinatorics, constructive
    symmetry classifications for materials — all publishable and
    foundational.

If you want, I can spin up the initial work plan for Track A
(Bootstrap) or Track D (QECC) right away: module layout, solver specs,
certification formats, and the first week’s experiments. Which track do
you want to lead with?
