Love this scope. Here’s a map of high‑level scientific areas—beyond
biology, chemistry, materials, and particle physics—where we can make
real progress with pure thought + fresh code only (no external datasets,
no lab work, no legacy software). For each, I name the core
objects/axioms and the kinds of verifiable artifacts (proofs,
certificates, tight bounds, constructive models) we can produce.

How to use this map

-   Pick 4–6 areas spanning PDE/continuum, information/algorithms,
    and geometry/topology so the tooling cross‑pollinates.

-   For each chosen area, we’ll target outputs that come
    with independent verifiers: proof assistants, SoS/SAT certificates,
    or interval‑arithmetic bounds.

If you tell me which of these resonate most with your mission, I’ll
propose a concrete “Week‑1” build plan per area (tooling, certification
formats, and first theorems/bounds to aim for).
