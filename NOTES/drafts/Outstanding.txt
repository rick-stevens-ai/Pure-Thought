Outstanding—quantum information + many‑body theory is tailor‑made for
“pure thought + fresh code only.” Below is a portfolio of problem
tracks where progress comes from axioms, convexity, algebra, and
combinatorics. Each track is feasible with our own solvers and
produces verifiable artifacts (SDP duals, SAT proofs,
interval‑arithmetic bounds, Lean/Isabelle lemmas). No data, no
experiments, no legacy codes.

Day‑0 tooling we build once and reuse

-   Noncommutative SDP/SoS & NPA: exact‑arithmetic semidefinite solvers
    (with dual certificates) for operator inequalities, correlation
    sets, and Bell bounds.

-   Stabilizer/QECC lab: code constructors (LDPC, hypergraph product,
    homological/fracton), distance lower‑bound certificates (SAT/MILP),
    and provable‑performance decoders.

-   Tensor‑network engine with certificates: MPS/PEPS/TN contractions,
    error bars via interval arithmetic; parent‑Hamiltonian and gap
    verifiers (Knabe/martingale methods).

-   Hamiltonian complexity kit: gadgets, perturbative reductions,
    commuting vs. non‑commuting checks, and proof logs.

-   Anyon/MTC algebra tools: fusion categories, modular data, anomaly
    tests (obstruction cocycles) with machine‑checked coherence.

What I’d start first (fastest path to rigorous, publishable wins)

-   QECC (A1–A3) for constructive codes + certificates.

-   Nonlocal games/self‑testing (B4–B6) using our NPA/nc‑SoS stack.

-   Gaps & parent Hamiltonians (E13) with an automated gap‑witness
    generator.

-   Sign‑problem (F21) classification with crisp SAT/ILP certificates.

-   Unitary designs (G22) for explicit, depth‑optimal constructions.

Week‑1 sprints (concrete)

-   Build: exact‑arithmetic SDP with block‑symmetry; NPA layers;
    DRAT/FRAT plumbing; interval‑arithmetic linear algebra.

-   Validate: reproduce known CHSH/Tsirelson value and a simple LDPC
    code’s distance with certificates.

-   Push: auto‑search a new Bell inequality family; run gap‑witness
    search on a small PEPS parent Hamiltonian; attempt a local‑basis
    stoquasticity decision on 2‑local instances—each returning
    machine‑checkable artifacts.

If you pick 3–5 tracks from above, I’ll draft module layouts,
certificate formats, and a day‑by‑day plan to get first results within
two weeks.
