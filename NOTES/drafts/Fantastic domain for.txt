Fantastic domain for “pure thought + fresh code.” Below is a portfolio
of problem tracks in celestial mechanics and planetary theory that need
no external data or legacy software—just axioms (Newton/GR
approximations), dynamical systems, number theory, and validated
numerics. Each item states what, why it fits the constraint, how we’d
attack it, and the verifiable artifacts we’d produce (machine‑checkable
proofs, certificates, interval bounds).

Day‑0 tooling (we build once, use everywhere)

-   Validated ODE/PDE numerics: interval arithmetic, Taylor
    models/Lohner algorithm, Krawczyk/radii‑polynomial a‑posteriori
    proofs; reversible symplectic integrators with certified error
    bounds.

-   Hamiltonian normal‑form engine: Lie transforms, Birkhoff/averaging
    to very high order, with rigorous remainder bounds.

-   KAM/Nekhoroshev/Arnold‑diffusion suite: Diophantine checks,
    quantitative KAM steps, Nekhoroshev exponents/domains,
    computer‑assisted diffusion proofs.

-   Invariant‑manifold & global dynamics: validated computation of
    stable/unstable manifolds, Conley index / covering relations to
    prove connections.

-   Algebraic geometry for polynomial
    systems: Gröbner/resultants/α‑theory for central configurations and
    periodic‑orbit conditions.

-   Control & optimization with certificates: Pontryagin solvers
    + barrier/Lyapunov certificates for feasibility/optimality.

Artifacts throughout: Lean/Isabelle lemmas, interval‑verified
enclosures, DRAT/FRAT logs (SAT), dual/Conley certificates, reproducible
code.

Where I’d start (fastest path to rigorous, publishable wins)

1.  Periodic orbits + invariant manifolds (Tracks D & G): validated
    periodic orbits and certified heteroclinic connections in
    CR3BP—clean, high‑impact artifacts.

2.  KAM/Nekhoroshev domains (Tracks A & C): quantitative,
    certificate‑based stability/chaos maps for generic planetary mass
    ratios.

3.  Central configurations (Track E): algebraic classification with
    α‑theory certificates—decisive and foundational.

Example Week‑1 plan (if you say “go”)

-   Stand up validated ODE engine (interval + symplectic), and a minimal
    Lie‑transform normal‑form library.

-   Reproduce a known CR3BP Lyapunov orbit with a proof enclosure, then
    validated stable/unstable manifolds; attempt first heteroclinic
    connection proof (Conley certificate).

-   Run the normal‑form engine on a two‑planet near‑integrable model;
    compute rigorous remainder bounds + a first KAM torus certificate.

-   Start Gröbner/α‑theory pipeline on symmetric 5‑body central
    configurations; target a complete certified list under a symmetry
    ansatz.

If you select 3–5 tracks, I’ll draft APIs, certificate formats, and a
day‑by‑day schedule to hit first certified results within two weeks.
