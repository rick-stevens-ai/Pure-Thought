You’re right—there’s a lot more “foundational” to go after than just
cranking more loops. Under your constraints (no external data, only code
we write + proofs/derivations), the sweet spot is axiom-driven
consistency for QFT+gravity: modularity, unitarity, causality, crossing,
symmetry, positivity. Here’s a focused menu
of quantum-gravity/particle-theory tracks where we can make genuine
headway and produce verifiable artifacts (proofs, certificates,
infeasibility witnesses), not just pretty numerics.

1) AdS₃ “Pure Gravity” via the Modular Bootstrap

Problem. Do extremal 2D CFTs with only Virasoro descendants below the
gap (the “pure AdS₃ gravity” dual) exist for large central charge c=24k?
Why it’s perfect. Entirely first-principles: modular invariance,
unitarity, integrality. No data.
Plan.

-   Build from scratch: a high-precision modular bootstrap/LP+SDP solver
    with exact rational certificates (dual functionals) and
    integer-degeneracy constraints.

-   Search for feasible partition functions with spectral gaps; when
    infeasible, return dual certificates = proof of impossibility for
    given (c, gap).
    Milestones.

-   60–90d: Reproduce known constraints (k=1 Monster point).

-   6–12mo: Either explicit extremal-like spectra at new k, or rigorous
    no-go regions (publishable).

2) Gravitational Positivity & Causality Bounds (Flat Space)

Problem. Bound higher-derivative operators in graviton EFTs (e.g., R²,
R³ terms) using analyticity/crossing/unitarity + eikonal/shockwave
causality.
Why it fits. Pure dispersion theory + convex optimization; certificates
are dual polynomials or SOS decompositions.
Plan.

-   Implement dispersion relations with subtractions compatible with
    gravity’s IR behavior; include t-channel pole handling and Regge
    tails.

-   Build SoS/SDP machinery that outputs dual certificates proving an
    operator region is forbidden/allowed.
    Milestones. 3–9mo: New multi-coupling bounds that tighten or
    disambiguate known results, with machine-checkable proofs.

3) Celestial CFT Bootstrap (4D QG ↔ 2D Celestial)

Problem. Enforce SL(2,ℂ) covariance, crossing, unitarity, and
soft-theorem constraints on celestial correlators to carve out the
consistent “celestial CFT” space for graviton scattering.
Why it fits. It’s all symmetry, kinematics, and consistency; verifiable
by symbolic/analytic checks.
Plan.

-   From scratch: Mellin transform pipeline for tree/1-loop toy
    amplitudes we derive ourselves, then impose celestial
    crossing/Regge/soft limits as SDP inequalities.

-   Produce extremal functionals that certify or exclude OPE data
    patterns.
    Milestones. 6–12mo: First rigorous “islands” or no-go regions for
    simple sectors (e.g., identical-helicity subsectors).

4) Modular-Lightcone Bootstrap for Stress-Tensor Dominated CFTs
(Holographic CFT)

Problem. In large-c, sparse-spectrum CFTs (holographic), derive sharp
bounds on higher-spin gaps/OPE coefficients implied by causality/chaos
(Regge) + crossing.
Why it fits. Uses only crossing, unitarity, modular constraints on
thermal correlators, and chaos bounds—no data.
Plan.

-   Implement Lorentzian inversion + lightcone expansions; certify
    inequalities via SDP/SoS.

-   Produce formal certificates that a given bulk higher-derivative term
    must be small/vanish to avoid superluminality/ANEC violation.
    Milestones. 6–9mo: Tighter “gravitational bootstrap” exclusion plots
    for higher-spin exchanges.

5) Positive Geometry for Gravity (Beyond Planar N=4 SYM)

Problem. Identify or rule out positive-geometry/canonical-form
structures (amplituhedron-like) for (super)gravity sectors.
Why it fits. Pure combinatorics/algebraic geometry; outputs are
constructive geometries and residue identities that we can symbolically
verify.
Plan.

-   Implement from scratch: canonical-form solvers for
    polytopes/Grassmannians; finite-field sampling + rational
    reconstruction for integrands; symbol integrability checks.

-   Search for minimal geometries reproducing low-loop graviton
    integrands we derive ourselves from on-shell recursion + unitarity
    cuts.
    Milestones. 9–12mo: New positive-geometry proposals or no-go
    theorems for specific helicity/loop sectors.

6) Non-perturbative S-matrix Bootstrap with Gravity Inputs

Problem. Carve out the space of unitary, crossing-symmetric,
analytic 2→2 amplitudes obeying gravitational soft theorems and proper
high-energy behavior.
Why it fits. Fully axiomatic; feasibility ↔ convex optimization with
certificates.
Plan.

-   Build partial-wave + Roy-like equation machinery adapted to massless
    exchange and IR dressing; impose soft (Weinberg) behavior as hard
    constraints.

-   Return dual certificates excluding inconsistent Wilson-coefficient
    tuples.
    Milestones. 6–12mo: First rigorous islands/exclusion regions for
    EFTs with gravity + light matter.

7) Extremal Higher-Dimensional CFTs with Stress Tensor (d>2)

Problem. Are there “nearly extremal” unitary CFTs in d=3,4 with a large
gap to higher-spin currents (pure-gravity-like holographic duals)?
Why it fits. Standard bootstrap + extremal functional method; no data.
Plan.

-   Mixed-correlator bootstrap including Tμν; certify islands/no-go via
    dual functionals.
    Milestones. 6–12mo: Stronger universal lower bounds on higher-spin
    gaps (holography-relevant).

8) Swampland-via-Modularity & Higher-Form Symmetries (AdS/CFT interface)

Problem. Use modularity, integrality, and higher-form symmetry
constraints to produce theorem-level obstructions to QG-inconsistent
spectra.
Why it fits. All logic; certificates = infeasibility proofs for
partition functions/OPE data subject to symmetry charges/anomalies.
Plan.

-   Couple modular bootstrap to discrete/higher-form anomaly constraints
    (cobordism-style).
    Milestones. 9–12mo: New rigorous “no such CFT” results under
    explicit symmetry assumptions.

What we’d actually build (once) and reuse everywhere

-   Modular/Conformal Bootstrap Stack (our own SDP with exact/rational
    logging → dual certificates; extremal functional solvers;
    lightcone/Regge modules).

-   Dispersive/Positivity Engine (sum rules with rigorous error control,
    SoS certificates, handling massless t-channel poles and Regge
    growth).

-   On-Shell/Amplitude Lab (BCFW + generalized unitarity we implement;
    symbol/integrability checker; finite-field + reconstruction;
    canonical-form finder).

-   Proof Channel for everything (Lean/Isabelle scripts for theorems;
    DRAT/FRAT for SAT instances; algebraic certificates for SOS/SDP).

Near-term “foundational” wins to target first

1.  AdS₃ extremal CFT existence/no-go at new k — either construction or
    certified impossibility is a genuine landmark.

2.  Multi-coupling gravitational EFT bounds with airtight dispersive
    certificates.

3.  Celestial bootstrap feasibility region for a minimal consistent
    subsector (a first real “island” would be big).

Pick any one and I’ll lay out the week-1 sprint (modules, proof objects,
and the first certification targets). My vote: start with AdS₃ modular
bootstrap (clearest path to a theorem), run gravitational positivity in
parallel, then bring in celestial once the dispersive stack is humming.
