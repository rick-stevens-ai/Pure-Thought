Love this direction. Chemistry has a deep tier of questions
where axioms, variational principles, symmetry, and combinatorics are
enough—you can make progress with proofs, constructive algorithms, and
certificates, plus code we write from scratch. Below is a targeted
portfolio. For each track I spell out what, why it fits the “no
data/experiments” constraint, how we’d attack it with thought + fresh
code, and what verifiable artifacts we’d produce.

Day‑0 “chemistry from first principles” toolchain (reused across tracks)

-   Exact algebra + certificates. Rational/arbitrary‑precision
    arithmetic, Gröbner bases, interval arithmetic; semidefinite
    programming (SoS) with exact dual certificates; SAT/SMT
    with DRAT/FRAT logs; all proofs exportable to Lean/Isabelle.

-   Electronic‑structure core (from scratch). Atom‑centered basis
    generator (hydrogenic/Slater/Gaussian), analytic integral engine,
    self‑consistent field (HF), post‑HF prototypes (CI/CC), and
    multi‑marginal optimal‑transport (OT) solvers; Ewald/PPPM for
    periodic Coulomb with a‑posteriori error bounds.

-   Chemical‑graph & reaction‑rewriting lab. Valence‑respecting graph
    grammars, isomorphism‑free enumeration, stereochemistry/chirality
    deciders, reachability and mechanism search via MILP/SAT with proof
    logs.

    cycle decompositions, entropy‑production bounds, fluctuation
    relations, barrier certificates.

-   Proof channel. Every claim yields machine‑checkable artifacts: Lean
    lemmas, SDP duals, SAT proofs, certified eigenvalue bounds.

chirality/knots), stereogenic axes/planes, and stereoisomer counts for
arbitrary molecular graphs.
Why. Group theory + knot/link invariants.
How.

Where I’d start (high leverage, near‑term wins)

1.  N‑representability & 2‑RDM (Track 1). Direct, foundational, and
    yields provable energy bounds that are publishable on their own.

2.  Non‑empirical DFT via convex analysis + SCE OT (Tracks 2–3). You get
    theorems about the universal functional and constructive extremals.

3.  Inverse statistical mechanics (Track 10). “Potentials with proofs”
    have big ripple effects across soft matter and colloidal chemistry.

    family via SOS moments; validate on pairing Hamiltonians we
    generate.

    lemmas proving constraint validity.

Sprint B — Convex DFT + SCE OT

    scaling) and a support‑function oracle for (F[\rho]) under known
    exact conditions.

-   Prototype multi‑marginal OT solver with dual potentials; certify
    bounds for symmetric test densities.

If you pick 2–3 tracks, I’ll draft the concrete APIs, certificate
formats, and day‑by‑day plan. Given your DOE mission focus, I’d
suggest 2‑RDM + Non‑empirical DFT/SCE (fundamental theory) and Inverse
Potentials (design with proofs) as the initial trio.
