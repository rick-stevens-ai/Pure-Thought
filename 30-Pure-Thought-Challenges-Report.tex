\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This report synthesizes analyses across fifteen scientific domains to identify the thirty most compelling challenges that can be tackled using \emph{pure thought and fresh code only}—requiring no external datasets, experiments, or legacy software. Each challenge is grounded in axioms, symmetries, and variational principles, and produces verifiable artifacts: mathematical proofs, certificates, impossibility theorems, or constructive models. These challenges span quantum gravity, materials science, quantum information theory, chemistry, celestial mechanics, and theoretical biology. We outline the mathematical foundations, verification strategies, and expected timelines for each challenge, along with the core computational infrastructure required across all domains.

\section{Introduction}

The advent of advanced artificial intelligence systems capable of extended reasoning presents a unique opportunity: the systematic exploration of fundamental scientific questions through \emph{pure thought}. Unlike data-driven or experimental approaches, pure thought challenges rely exclusively on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Axiomatic foundations}: unitarity, causality, crossing symmetry, modular invariance, group theory
    \item \textbf{Mathematical structures}: convex optimization, algebraic topology, representation theory
    \item \textbf{Verifiable artifacts}: machine-checkable proofs, infeasibility certificates, constructive counterexamples
    \item \textbf{Self-written code}: all solvers, verifiers, and proof checkers implemented from first principles
\end{itemize}

This paradigm eliminates dependence on external datasets, legacy software, or experimental validation, instead producing results whose correctness can be independently verified through mathematical proof.

This report identifies thirty such challenges across six major domains, each selected for:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Scientific impact}: addresses foundational open questions
    \item \textbf{Tractability}: achievable milestones within 3--12 months
    \item \textbf{Verifiability}: produces certificates checkable by proof assistants (Lean, Isabelle) or exact solvers
    \item \textbf{Axiom-driven}: requires no empirical data or experimental inputs
\end{enumerate}

\section{Quantum Gravity and Particle Physics}

The bootstrap program in quantum field theory and quantum gravity exploits consistency conditions—unitarity, crossing symmetry, causality, and modular invariance—to constrain or uniquely determine physical theories without perturbative expansions\cite{Rattazzi2008,Poland2019}.

\subsection{AdS\texorpdfstring{$_3$}{3} ``Pure Gravity'' via the Modular Bootstrap}

\textbf{Challenge:} Determine whether extremal two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with only Virasoro descendants below the gap exist for large central charge $c = 24k$, corresponding to pure AdS$_3$ gravity duals.

\textbf{Why Compelling:} The existence or rigorous impossibility of such theories would resolve a foundational question in the AdS/CFT correspondence\cite{Maloney2016,Hartman2014}. Extremal CFTs at $c=24$ are related to the Monster group, and their generalization to $c=24k$ remains open.

\textbf{Pure Thought Approach:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement high-precision modular bootstrap solvers combining linear programming (LP) and semidefinite programming (SDP) with exact rational certificates
    \item Enforce modular invariance: $\mathcal{Z}(\tau) = \mathcal{Z}(-1/\tau)$, unitarity (positive degeneracies), and integrality constraints
    \item Search for feasible partition functions with specified spectral gaps
    \item When infeasible, extract dual certificates proving impossibility for given $(c, \Delta_{\text{gap}})$ pairs
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Verifiable Artifacts:} SDP dual functionals (exact rational certificates), infeasibility proofs, or explicit extremal spectra

\textbf{Timeline:} 60--90 days to reproduce known constraints (e.g., $k=1$ Monster point); 6--12 months for new results

\section{Selection Principles and Execution Strategy}

\subsection{Why These 30 Challenges?}

Each challenge was selected based on five criteria:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Proofs over predictions}: Resolves to theorems, bounds, constructive counterexamples, or certificates—not approximate numerics

    \item \textbf{Axiom-driven}: Relies exclusively on unitarity, causality, crossing, locality, symmetry, convexity (physics); quantum mechanics and variational principles (chemistry); formal axioms (mathematics/computer science)

    \item \textbf{Verifiable search}: Uses massive search guided by reasoning systems, but demands fast verifiers (proof checkers, symbolic algebra, certificate validation)

    \item \textbf{Formalized by default}: Produces both human-readable proofs and machine-checkable artifacts (Lean/Isabelle, DRAT/FRAT, SoS certificates, interval bounds)

    \item \textbf{Tractable with impact}: Achievable milestones within 3--12 months addressing foundational open questions
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Execution Pattern}

For each track:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Toolchain development}: Emit self-contained solver + checker + proof exporter

    \item \textbf{Many-shot strategy generation}: Vary gauges, bases, relaxations, search strategies

    \item \textbf{Parallel search with early certification}: Run multiple proof attempts in parallel; immediately verify candidates

    \item \textbf{Human-readable synthesis}: Once machine certificate exists, synthesize polished exposition
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Resource Allocation}

\textbf{Token/compute budget:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 80\% to search and proof attempts
    \item 20\% to verification and proof polishing
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Initial focus} (highest-likelihood short-term wins):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item AdS$_3$ modular bootstrap (Track 1)
    \item LDPC quantum codes (Track 21)
    \item Minimal autocatalytic networks (Track 29)
    \item RBCE symmetry atlas (Track 11)
    \item Gravitational positivity bounds (Track 2)
\end{enumerate}

    \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\section{Conclusion}

This portfolio of thirty pure thought challenges represents the frontier of what mathematical reasoning, amplified by advanced artificial intelligence, can achieve in fundamental science. Unlike data-driven or experimental approaches, these challenges require:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No external datasets}: all information derives from axioms and first principles
    \item \textbf{No experiments}: verification is mathematical, not empirical
    \item \textbf{No legacy software}: all solvers implemented from scratch with proof generation
\end{itemize}

The results—theorem-level bounds, impossibility certificates, constructive models—are independently verifiable through proof assistants and exact arithmetic, ensuring correctness without trust.

Success across even a subset of these challenges would demonstrate that pure mathematical reasoning, when properly formalized and computationally amplified, can resolve longstanding open questions spanning quantum gravity, materials design, quantum information, chemistry, celestial mechanics, and theoretical biology.

The key innovation is not numerical approximation but \emph{certified reasoning}: every claim accompanied by a machine-checkable proof. This paradigm complements experimental and computational science with a third pillar—\emph{axiomatic science}—where progress is measured not in predictive accuracy but in theorems proven.
